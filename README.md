# My Project
=======
Welcome to My Project! This repository showcases my coding abilities and understanding of Django framework through four distinct applications:

Forum: A fully-featured forum that supports CRUD operations and demonstrates database relationships. Users can create, read, update, and delete posts, as well as engage in discussions through comments.

HIIT Workout Timer: An interactive High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) tracker. This tool allows users to set and track their workout routines in real-time.

Notes: An application designed to help users keep track of important notes and reminders. The app demonstrates a CRUD model with the added complexity of user-defined reminders.

User Profile: This application enables users to manage their profiles including changing profile pictures, updating personal details, and managing reminders. It showcases user authentication and user-specific data handling
